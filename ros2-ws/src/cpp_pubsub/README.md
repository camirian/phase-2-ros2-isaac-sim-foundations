# ROS 2 C++ Publisher/Subscriber Package (cpp_pubsub)

This package demonstrates the fundamental publisher/subscriber communication pattern in C++, the language of choice for high-performance robotics applications.

## Purpose & Skills Demonstrated

This project mirrors the functionality of the Python `py_pubsub` package to showcase versatility in both high-level scripting and low-level compiled languages. Key skills demonstrated include:

-   **C++ for Robotics:** Writing clean, modern C++ (17) code.
-   **RCLCPP Proficiency:** Using the ROS 2 C++ client library to create nodes, publishers, subscribers, and timers.
-   **CMake for ROS 2:** Configuring a `CMakeLists.txt` file to compile C++ source code into executables and link against ROS 2 libraries.
-   **Memory Management:** Using smart pointers (`std::make_shared`) for efficient node and message handling.
